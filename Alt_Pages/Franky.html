            <img src="../Images/Franky.gif" alt="gif of Luffy laughing">

            <p>Franky, also known as "Cutty Flam," is a fascinating and unique character in the One Piece universe. He is a cyborg who initially appears as a villain, but eventually becomes an ally and member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Franky is a shipwright, which means that he is responsible for designing and building ships. He is an expert in shipbuilding, having designed and built the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hat Pirates' ship.

            <br>
            Franky's cyborg body is one of the most impressive in the One Piece world. He has a number of built-in weapons, including rocket launchers, cannons, and laser beams. He also has an incredible amount of strength, which he uses to great effect in battles. Despite his fearsome appearance, Franky is a kind and loyal friend. He is fiercely loyal to his friends and crewmates, and will do anything to protect them.
            <br>
            <br>    
            One of the most interesting things about Franky is his love for fashion and music. He is always decked out in outrageous outfits, and has a passion for disco music. He even has a built-in speaker system in his body that he uses to blast his favorite tunes. Overall, Franky is a unique and charismatic character who brings a lot of personality and humor to the One Piece universe.</p>
