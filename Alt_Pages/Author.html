            <p>Eiichiro Oda is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the popular manga and anime series, One Piece. Born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, Oda began his career as a manga artist in 1992 with his debut work, Wanted!. He then went on to work as an assistant for several well-known manga artists, including Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator of Rurouni Kenshin.
