            <img src="../Images/Jinbe.gif" alt="gif of Luffy laughing">

            <p>Jinbe is a fishman and a former Shichibukai who becomes an ally and member of the Straw Hat Pirates in the One Piece anime and manga series. He is a highly respected figure in the fishman community and is known for his great strength and wisdom. Jinbe is also a skilled fighter, capable of using fishman karate to great effect in battle.

            <br>
            One of the most interesting things about Jinbe is his sense of honor and loyalty. He has a strong sense of justice and is willing to stand up for what is right, even if it means going against his own kind. He has shown this in the past by standing up to the World Government when they were mistreating fishmen, and by breaking ties with the Shichibukai when he realized their actions went against his principles.
            <br>
            <br>    
            Jinbe is also known for his wisdom and calm demeanor. He is often sought out for advice and guidance by his fellow Straw Hat crew members, as well as other characters in the series. He has a deep understanding of the world and its workings, which has helped him to navigate many difficult situations.
            <br>
            <br>    
            Overall, Jinbe is a highly respected and beloved character in the One Piece universe. He brings a lot of depth and complexity to the story, and his sense of honor and wisdom make him a valuable member of the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
