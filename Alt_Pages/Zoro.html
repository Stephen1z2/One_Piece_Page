However, during his training, Zoro's mentor was killed by a corrupt government agent. Despite this setback, Zoro continued to hone his skills, eventually becoming a fearsome pirate hunter. When he meets Luffy, he recognizes the potential for adventure and challenge in joining the crew, and eagerly accepts Luffy's invitation to become a Straw Hat Pirate.
