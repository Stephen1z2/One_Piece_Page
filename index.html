            <h2>A little about how I got into One Piece</h2>

            <p>Ever since I was a kid I have enjoyed watching anime. The first anime I had ever watch was probably pokemon. I remember watching One Piece for the first time when I was around ten years old. It would play every day after school and I loved it. Unfortuantly, it stopped airing maybe 150 episodes into the show. I wouldn't pick it up again till streaming services started getting popular and cruncyroll was created. Cruncyroll is a fantastic one stop shop for streaming anime. I was eventually able to catch up with the anime (all 800 episodes) and couldn't wait for more. That is when I started reading the source material for the anime. The One Piece manga which if you don't know a manga is a japanese comic book. I can tell you I lost no enjoyment going from watching the show to just reading it. The author does an amazing job fleshing out the world and its characters. I think my favorite part about One Piece is that every character whether its the main or side characters all get their time to shine. It truly is an amazing well thought out world and adventure.</p>
